# NPMap Builder

The NPMap Builder is a graphical interface that can be used to build maps with the [NPMap.js library](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap.js). The Builder is intended to be a quick start for developing and deploying maps to the web. It is not intended to cover every use case - and it never will. Those who want to add advanced functionality or customizations to their map will need to use NPMap.js's [API](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap.js/blob/master/API.md).

That said, output from the builder should provide a good base starting point for all maps - even those that require additional customizations.

# Status

The NPMap Builder is a work-in-progress. Consider the code pre-alpha and the feature set incomplete.
