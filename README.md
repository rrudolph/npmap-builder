# NPMap Builder

The NPMap Builder provides a graphical interface that can be used to build maps on top of the [NPMap JavaScript library](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap). The builder is intended to be a quick start for building and deploying maps to the web. It is not intended to cover every use case, and it never will. This means that those who want to add advanced functionality to their map will still need to understand at least the basics of JavaScript and utilize NPMap's [API](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/library/api/).

That being said, output from the builder should provide a good starting point for all maps - even those that have a lot of advanced/custom requirements.
